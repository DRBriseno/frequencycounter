Now this is the story all about how
My life got flipped turned upside down
And I'd like to take a minute just sit right there
Ill tell you how I became the prince of a town called BelAir
In West Philadelphia born and raised
On the playground is where I spent most of my days
Chilling out maxing relaxing all cool
And all shooting some beeball outside of the school
When a couple of guys who we're up to no good
Started making trouble in my neighbourhood
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
And said you're moving with your aunty and uncle in BelAir
I begged and pleaded with her day after day
But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way
She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket
I put my walkman on and said I might as well kick it
First class yo this is bad
Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass
Is this what the people of BelAir are livin like
Hmm this might be alright
I whistled for a cab and when it came near
The license plate said fresh and had a dice in the mirror
If anything I could say that this cab was rare
But I though nah forget it yo holmes to BelAir
I pulled up to a house about seven or eight
And I yelled to the cabby yo holmes smell you later
Looked at my kingdom I was finally there
To sit on my throne as the Prince of BelAir
